QSpiceSix's Jupyter Notebooks

[Notebook-1](https://github.com/avedmala/burlapandbarrel/blob/main/Notebook-1.ipynb) is our first notebook we used to perform a lot of cleaning and transformations. We also made most of our plots here and explored some modeling.

[Notebook-2](https://github.com/avedmala/burlapandbarrel/blob/main/Notebook-2.ipynb) is more focused on models. We also refocused on the original scope in Notebook-2 and drew some important conclusions which were used for our final recommendations.

Here is a link to a Google Drive folder with the notebooks and data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XYEJJTeLP9WyAr5yOGwdsqPexGND1V4X?usp=share_link

The maps render in collab so it's worth looking at that if you want to interact with them but you don't want to re-run the whole thing.
